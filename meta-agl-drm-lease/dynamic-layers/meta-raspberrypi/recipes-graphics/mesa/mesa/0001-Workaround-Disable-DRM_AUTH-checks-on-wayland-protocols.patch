Subject: [PATCH] Workaround: Disable DRM_AUTH check on wayland protocols

DRM authentication does not work via a DRM Leases because the client
can only authenticate against a lease owner (primary node), since
the lease does not have a corresponding device file in the filesystem
for clients to open.

The wl_drm protocol needs authentication to import/export prime fds
on kernel versions < 5.6.  For newer kernel versions, prime
import/export no longer requires DRM_AUTH, so processing can proceed
even if DRM authentication fails.

A proper implementation would check if the device is actually a
DRM lease and/or whether the import/export can succeed without
authentication.  For now, just try to authenticate and ignore
any failures.
